ncc - Nartov C Compiler
Copyright 2010-2011  Alexander Nartov

Description
-----------

ncc is a simple C compiler that has been developed by me during
"Programming languages and translation methods" course in the university.

Its implementation of C language standard isn't complete, only a subset is
supported. See file named grammar for more information.

The compiler generates code in GNU Assembler AT&T syntax for x86 platform.

Features
--------

- scanning and parsing of C code;
- generating AT&T syntax x86 assembler code for GAS;
- outputting a parse tree;
- outputting symbol tables;
- high and low-level optimizations, e.g.:
	- constant folding;
	- loop invariant hoisting;
	- unreachable code elimination.


Compatibility note
------------------

Compiler generates code that is compatible with GNU/Linux ABI and probably
needs some modifications for generated code to work on other platforms.
